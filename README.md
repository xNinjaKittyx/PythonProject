# PythonProject

This is a typical baseline for any python project that I would start.


- This is not a one size fits all. Fast prototypes or small hobby projects using this would be overkill. It's ok to be messy sometimes.
- However, when collaborating with others and once the project is a decent size, it would be very helpful have tools like this to catch common mistakes, so you can focus more on the content rather than the looks. Again, might not be the tools you like, but its the ones I like.
- I just wanted to design something. Answering the question: How would *I* organize my pure python project?
